# Clerk Authentication Setup

This project has been configured with Clerk authentication using the latest Next.js App Router approach.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Clerk Account
1. Go to [https://clerk.com/](https://clerk.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new application

### 2. Get Your API Keys
1. In your Clerk Dashboard, go to "API Keys"
2. Copy your **Publishable Key** and **Secret Key**

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
1. Open the `.env.local` file in your project root
2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Clerk keys:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_actual_publishable_key_here
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_actual_secret_key_here
```

### 4. Run the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Test Authentication
1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
2. You should see sign-in and sign-up buttons in the header
3. Click "Sign Up" to create a test account
4. After signing up, you should see the UserButton in the header

## What's Been Implemented

### ✅ Core Clerk Integration
- **Middleware**: `middleware.ts` with `clerkMiddleware()` from `@clerk/nextjs/server`
- **Provider**: App wrapped with `<ClerkProvider>` in `app/layout.tsx`
- **Components**: Sign-in/Sign-up buttons and UserButton in the layout
- **Environment**: `.env.local` file with Clerk environment variables

### ✅ Authentication Components
- **UserProfile**: Custom component demonstrating `useUser()` hook
- **Layout Integration**: Authentication buttons in the header
- **Protected Content**: Example of conditional rendering based on auth state

### ✅ File Structure
```
├── middleware.ts                 # Clerk middleware configuration
├── app/
│   └── layout.tsx               # ClerkProvider wrapper
│   └── page.tsx                 # Updated with UserProfile component
├── components/
│   └── UserProfile.tsx          # Example auth component
└── .env.local                   # Environment variables (add your keys here)
```

## Key Features

1. **Automatic Authentication**: Users are automatically authenticated across your app
2. **Modal Sign-in/Sign-up**: Clean modal experience for authentication
3. **User Management**: Built-in user profile management with UserButton
4. **Protected Routes**: Middleware automatically protects your routes
5. **React Hooks**: Use `useUser()`, `useAuth()`, and other Clerk hooks

## Next Steps

1. **Add your Clerk keys** to `.env.local`
2. **Customize authentication flow** by updating the UserProfile component
3. **Protect specific pages** by adding authentication checks
4. **Add user roles** and permissions as needed
5. **Customize the appearance** using Clerk's theming options

## Important Notes

- The `.env.local` file is already in `.gitignore` to keep your keys secure
- This implementation uses the latest Clerk SDK with App Router support
- All authentication state is managed automatically by Clerk
- The middleware protects all routes by default (you can customize this in `middleware.ts`)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Ensure your environment variables are correctly set
2. Restart your development server after adding environment variables
3. Check the Clerk Dashboard for any configuration issues
4. Verify you're using the correct API keys for your environment (development vs production)
